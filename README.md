GetCleanData_Project
====================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. I will be submitting: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to this Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. I am also including this README.md in the repo with my scripts. This README.md explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Task

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 

Here are the data for the project:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Scripts

The dataset includes the following files:

-README.md: This file

-run_analysis.R: The R code used to create Project_tidyData.txt.  It is well documented with my reasoning for why I did what to the data.

-CodeBook.md: This describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

-project_tidyData.txt: The tidy data set created by this project.
